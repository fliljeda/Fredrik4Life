Fredrik4Life is an Android app created in Android Studio with the purpose of being a fun side project for myself and practising Android. The idea of the app is to put many small ideas into one app so you don't have to download a new app for every small real life problem you have. An example is the first addition I made which is a dice for times you have your phone but no dice lying around, pretty clever imho.
